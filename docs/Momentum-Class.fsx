# Price momentum
Price momentum is one of the most common quant signals. It is (fairly)
straight forward to calculate, and you only need returns to do it,
so it is a good starting point and reference 'strategy'.

## Input data
Create a type that represents the file.
This code figures out what the columns of the csv file are.

- `Sample` is the path to our file. We assume in our source
directory there is a folder called `data`. Inside this data
folder we have our csv file.  
- `ResolutionFolder` to indicate what folder relative paths
  are relative to.

First, let's verify that the csv file exists where we think it will be.
*)
let [<Literal>] ResolutionFolder = __SOURCE_DIRECTORY__

let [<Literal>] CsvFile = "data/msf-momentum.csv"

if IO.File.Exists(ResolutionFolder + "/" + CsvFile) then 
    printfn "Success!!"
else
    let filesThere = IO.Directory.EnumerateFiles(ResolutionFolder,
                                                 searchPattern = "*",
                                                 searchOption=IO.SearchOption.AllDirectories)
    printfn "We did not find the file. Here are the files in your source directory.\n"
    filesThere |> Seq.iteri (printfn "%i. %A")

(**
Assuming that you got "Success!!" above this code below will work.
*)
type MsfCsv = CsvProvider<Sample=CsvFile,
                          ResolutionFolder=ResolutionFolder>

// assign the content of the file to a value
let msfCsv = MsfCsv.GetSample()

(** look at the file attributes *)
msfCsv

(** look at the headers *)
msfCsv.Headers

(** look at the first few rows *)
msfCsv.Rows |> Seq.truncate 3

## Signal construction
We want to create a momentum signal and see how it relates to future returns.
The signal is some measure of past returns. A common measure is the past year return,
skipping the most recent month. We skip the most recent month because stocks tend
to reverse following very recent returns (known as "reversals"). 
The reversal is very likely a liquidity effect and it is less important this century.
So returns are positively correlated with returns from 12 months to 1 months ago, 
but negatively correlated with returns last month. This is illustrated very nicely
in Jegadeesh (1990).

If we're forming a portfolio at the end of month $t-1$ to hold in month $t$, 
then we're saying returns in month $t$ are positively correlated
with returns in months $t-12$ through month $t-2$.
For example, if we want to hold a momenum portfolio in January 2021, 
then we will form it on December 31, 2020.
We will want to go long stocks that had high returns from the beginning 
of January 2020 to the end of November 2020.

Let's create a record to hold some info about past returns for a stock.
We will use this as a trading signal.
*)

type PriorReturnOb = 
    { SecurityId : SecurityId
      FormationMonth : YearMonth 
      Retm12m2 : float
      N : int }

(**
Note the `YearMonth` type for portfolio formation month.
This type is from the library [NodaTime](https://nodatime.org/). 

Why are we using it? Date math is hard and easy to mess up.

We're dealing with monthly data.
If we use `DateTime`, then we have to give the month a 
day value. We could always use the first day of the month,
but then month return goes all the way to the end of the month.
And we might forget that information. 

If we use the last day of the month,
then what happens when we add months. For example,
we have to start doing things like.
*)

let endOfFebruary = DateTime(2020,2,28)
let endOfFebruaryPlus1Month = endOfFebruary.AddMonths(1)
let endOfMarch = DateTime(endOfFebruary.Year,endOfFebruary.Month,1).AddMonths(2).AddDays(-1.0)
endOfFebruaryPlus1Month = endOfMarch // evaluates to false

(**
That's kind of ugly. 

We also have to worry about things like what happens
if we add a month but it overlapped with daylight savings time?
What about timezones? If we're never dealing with times,
it's nice to ignore all these things.

This is nicer way of doing it using nodatime's `YearMonth`:
*)

let february = YearMonth(2020,2) 
let februaryPlus1Month = february.PlusMonths(1)
let march = YearMonth(2020,3)
februaryPlus1Month = march // true

(**
Let's focus on a single stock.
*)

let amznReturns = 
    // we're filtering and then storing as a map.
    // if we used a sequence instead of a map/arra/list, then
    // every time we used amznReturns, the sequence
    // would be recreated by filtering msfCsv.Rows.
    // That's one difference between (lazy) seq and
    // (eager) array/list/map.
    msfCsv.Rows
    |> Seq.filter(fun x -> x.Ticker = "AMZN")
    |> Seq.map(fun x ->
        let ym = YearMonth(x.Month.Year,x.Month.Month) 
        let key = Permno x.Permno, ym
        key, x)
    |> Map.ofSeq

let getPastYearObs 
    (returns:Map<(SecurityId * YearMonth),MsfCsv.Row>)
    (security: SecurityId, formationMonth: YearMonth) =
        [ -11 .. -1 ]
        |> List.choose(fun i -> 
            let returnMonth = formationMonth.PlusMonths(i)
            Map.tryFind (security, returnMonth) returns)    

// check Permno 84788 is Amzn
let amznPermno = Permno 84788
getPastYearObs amznReturns (amznPermno, YearMonth(2019,1))  
getPastYearObs amznReturns (Permno -400, YearMonth(2019,1))  

// making cumulative returns 
let cumulativeReturn rets =
    // using Seq so that it will work with any collection
    let cumulativeLogReturn =
        rets |> Seq.sumBy (fun r -> log (1.0 + r))
    exp(cumulativeLogReturn) - 1.0

(** check *)
cumulativeReturn []
cumulativeReturn [1.0;-0.5]

(** check *)
cumulativeReturn [0.1; 0.1; 0.1; 0.1]

1.1 ** 4.0 - 1.0

(**
We're now ready to create our Momentum signal function.
*)

// If you don't want to write the typessecurity, month all the time.
// 

let getMomentumSignal returns (security, formationMonth) =
    let priorObs = getPastYearObs  returns (security, formationMonth)
    let priorRets = priorObs |> List.choose(fun x -> x.Ret)
    // We should probably return None if there are no observations.
    // If they are all missing, Array.choose will return an empty
    // array. See:
    // ([| None; None |]: int option []) |> Array.choose id
    //
    // So we'll check for an empty array and return None in that case.
    if List.isEmpty priorRets then
        None 
    else
        Some { SecurityId = security 
               FormationMonth = formationMonth
               Retm12m2 = cumulativeReturn priorRets
               N = priorRets.Length }

// Check
getMomentumSignal amznReturns (amznPermno, YearMonth(2019,1)) 
getMomentumSignal amznReturns (Permno -400, YearMonth(2019,1))  

(**
One thing you may notice is that our momentum signal function gets everything from
it's inputs. That means that if we give it different intputs then
we could get momentum signals for other stocks. 

For example we can create a map collection like we had for amzn, but for all stocks.
*)

let msfByPermnoMonth =
    msfCsv.Rows
    |> Seq.map(fun x ->
        let ym = YearMonth(x.Month.Year,x.Month.Month) 
        let key = Permno x.Permno, ym
        key, x)
    |> Map.ofSeq

// finding some permnos for notable tickers

// don't use tickers. companies change tickers, so you might look up the wrong company
// That's why I'm picking some tickers that I know haven't changed, but my function
// is using PERMNO.

let notableTicks =
    ["MSFT";"AAPL";"HOG"]
    |> Seq.map(fun tick -> 
        msfCsv.Rows
        // hover over 'find' in 'Seq.find' if you don't remember what it does. 
        |> Seq.find(fun row -> row.Ticker = tick)
        |> fun row -> row.Ticker, row.Permno)
    |> Map.ofSeq

let msftPermno = Permno notableTicks["MSFT"]
let aaplPermno = Permno notableTicks["AAPL"]
let hogPermno = Permno notableTicks["HOG"]

let msftTestIndex = (msftPermno, YearMonth(2019,1))
let aaplTestIndex = (aaplPermno, YearMonth(2019,1))  

getMomentumSignal msfByPermnoMonth msftTestIndex 
getMomentumSignal msfByPermnoMonth aaplTestIndex  

(**
and we can use [partial function application](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/partial-application/)
to "bake in" the msfByPermnoMonth parameter so that we don't keep having to pass it around.
*)

let getMomentumSignalAny = getMomentumSignal msfByPermnoMonth

getMomentumSignalAny msftTestIndex 
getMomentumSignalAny aaplTestIndex

## Defining the investment universe

Let's say we have a portfolio formation month. Can we look up securities available to invest in?

*)

let securitiesByFormationMonth =
    msfCsv.Rows
    |> Seq.groupBy(fun x -> YearMonth(x.Month.Year, x.Month.Month))
    |> Seq.map(fun (ym, xs) -> 
        ym, 
        xs 
        |> Seq.map(fun x -> Permno x.Permno) 
        |> Seq.toList)
    |> Map.ofSeq

let getInvestmentUniverse formationMonth =
    match Map.tryFind formationMonth securitiesByFormationMonth with
    | Some securities -> 
        { FormationMonth = formationMonth 
          Securities = securities }
    | None -> failwith $"{formationMonth} is not in the date range"      

getInvestmentUniverse (YearMonth(2011,10))
// getInvestmentUniverse (YearMonth(1990,10))

(**
You might also want to filter the investment universe by some criteria.
*)


let isCommonStock securityFormationMonth =
    match Map.tryFind securityFormationMonth msfByPermnoMonth with
    | None -> false
    | Some x -> List.contains x.Shrcd [10; 11]

let onNyseNasdaqAmex securityFormationMonth =
    match Map.tryFind securityFormationMonth msfByPermnoMonth with
    | None -> false
    | Some x -> List.contains x.Exchcd [ 1; 2; 3]

let hasPrice13mAgo (security, formationMonth:YearMonth) =
    //13m before the holding month, 12m before the formation month
    match Map.tryFind (security, formationMonth.PlusMonths(-12)) msfByPermnoMonth with
    | None -> false
    | Some m13 -> m13.Prc.IsSome

let hasReturn2mAgo (security, formationMonth:YearMonth) =
    //2m before the holding month, 1m before the formation month
    match Map.tryFind (security, formationMonth.PlusMonths(-1)) msfByPermnoMonth with
    | None -> false
    | Some m2 -> m2.Ret.IsSome

let hasMe1mAgo (security, formationMonth) =
    //1m before the holding month, so the formation month
    match Map.tryFind (security, formationMonth) msfByPermnoMonth with
    | None -> false
    | Some m1 -> m1.Prc.IsSome && m1.Shrout.IsSome

let has8ReturnsPastYear securityFormationMonth =
    match getMomentumSignalAny securityFormationMonth with 
    | None -> false 
    | Some x -> x.N >= 8

let danielMoskowitzRestrictions securityFormationMonth =
    isCommonStock securityFormationMonth &&
    onNyseNasdaqAmex securityFormationMonth &&
    hasPrice13mAgo securityFormationMonth &&
    hasReturn2mAgo securityFormationMonth &&
    hasMe1mAgo securityFormationMonth &&
    has8ReturnsPastYear securityFormationMonth 

let restrictUniverse (investmentUniverse: InvestmentUniverse) =
    let filtered =
        investmentUniverse.Securities
        |> List.filter(fun security -> 
            danielMoskowitzRestrictions (security, investmentUniverse.FormationMonth))
    { FormationMonth = investmentUniverse.FormationMonth
      Securities = filtered }        

(**
Now we can see where we are.

let investmentUniverse =
    YearMonth(2011,10)

## Momentum signals for our investment universe
Let's look at how to transform our array of securities in our investment
universe into an array with the signals.

Recall that our momentum function returns a type of observation specific to momentum.
*)

getMomentumSignalAny (Permno 84788, YearMonth(2019,1)) 
(*** include-fsi-output ***)

(**
This is fine, but if we want our code to work with any type of signal,
then we need to transform it into something more generic.

This is the purpose of the `SecuritySignal` record in the `Portfolio` module.
It's the same thing that we had in the simpler portfolio formation example.
It can represent any signal that is a float.
And to hold an array of security signals for a particular month,
we now have the type `SecuritiesWithSignals` also from the `Portfolio` module.

Let's write a function that transforms our momentum signal into a more generic
security signal.
*)

let getMomentumSecuritySignal (security, formationMonth ) =
    match getMomentumSignalAny (security, formationMonth) with
    | None -> None
    | Some signalOb ->
        let signal = { SecurityId = security; Signal = signalOb.Retm12m2 }
        Some signal

(** Now compare *)
getMomentumSignalAny (Permno 84788, YearMonth(2019,1)) 
(*** include-fsi-output ***)

getMomentumSecuritySignal (Permno 84788, YearMonth(2019,1)) 
(*** include-fsi-output ***)

(**
Now a function that takes our investment universe and returns
our securities with their (now more generic) signal.
*)

let getMomentumSignals (investmentUniverse: InvestmentUniverse) =
    let arrayOfSecuritySignals =
        investmentUniverse.Securities
        |> List.choose(fun security -> 
            getMomentumSecuritySignal (security, investmentUniverse.FormationMonth))    
    
    { FormationMonth = investmentUniverse.FormationMonth 
      Signals = arrayOfSecuritySignals }

restrictedInvestmentUniverse
|> getMomentumSignals


// or, if we want to look at the full pipeline
YearMonth(2015,7)
|> getInvestmentUniverse
|> restrictUniverse
|> getMomentumSignals


(**
## Assigning portfolios
Now that we have the signals for our portfolio,
we can assign portfolios. For many strategies it
is common to use decile sorts. This means that
you sort securities into 10 portfolios based on the signal.
But other numbers of portfolios (tercile = 3, quintile = 5, etc)
are also common.

There's a tradeoff between signal strength and diversification.
More portfolios means that top/bottom portfolios are stronger bets
on the signal. But there are fewer securities,
so they are also less diversified. Often, the trade-off between
a stronger signal vs. less diversificaton balances out.
Specifically, long-short tercile sorts may have a lower return spread
than decile sorts. But since terciles are better diversified,
the tercile and decile shorts are not as different when looking 
at sharpe ratios.

The `Portfolio` module has a function named `assignSignalSorts`
to form portfolios by sorting securities into `n` groups.

## Calculating Portfolio weights

We'll use a value-weight scheme. So we need a function that gets market capitalizations.

*)

let getMarketCap (security, formationMonth) =
    match Map.tryFind (security, formationMonth) msfByPermnoMonth with
    | None -> None
    | Some x -> 
        match x.Prc, x.Shrout with 
        // we need valid price and valid shrout to get market caps
        | Some prc, Some shrout -> Some (security, prc*shrout)
        // anything else and we can't calculate it
        | _ -> None

(**
Some examples.
*)

getMarketCap (amznPermno, YearMonth(2019,1)) // Some marketCap
getMarketCap (amznPermno, YearMonth(2030,1)) // In the future, so None

let exampleCapitalizations =
    [| getMarketCap (amznPermno, YearMonth(2019,1))
       getMarketCap (hogPermno, YearMonth(2019,1)) |]
    |> Array.choose id // to unwrap the options

let exampleValueWeights =
    let tot = exampleCapitalizations |> Array.sumBy snd
    exampleCapitalizations
    |> Array.map(fun (_id, cap) -> cap / tot )
    |> Array.sortDescending
(*** include-fsi-output ***)

(**
Now imagining we have the same example in terms of an assigned portfolio
with made up signals.
*)

let mktCapExPort: AssignedPortfolio =
    { PortfolioId = Named("Mkt Cap Example")
      FormationMonth = YearMonth(2019,1)
      Signals = [ { SecurityId = amznPermno; Signal = 1.0 }
                  { SecurityId = hogPermno; Signal = 1.0 } ] }

(**
The portfolio module has a function that can help us.
It has two inputs.

- A function that gets market capitalizations
- An assigned portfolio

We should see that it gives the same value weights.
*)                  

let exampleValueWeights2 =
    giveValueWeights getMarketCap mktCapExPort

(*** include-fsi-output ***)

(**
So now we can construct our portfolios with value weights.
*)

let portfoliosWithWeights =
    YearMonth(2015,7)
    |> getInvestmentUniverse
    |> restrictUniverse
    |> getMomentumSignals
    |> assignSignalSort "Momentum" 10
    |> List.map (giveValueWeights getMarketCap)

(**
Note that because of the size distribution,
some of these portfolios are not very diversified.
This is illustrated by inspecting maximum portfolio
weights.
*)
portfoliosWithWeights
|> List.map(fun port -> 
    port.PortfolioId,
    port.Positions |> List.map(fun pos -> pos.Weight) |> List.max,
    port.Positions |> List.sumBy(fun pos -> pos.Weight))


(**
## Calculating Portfolio returns

We need our function to get returns given weights.

We can start with a function that gets returns.
It looks a lot like our function to get market capitalizations.

*)

let getSecurityReturn (security, formationMonth) =
    // If the security has a missing return, assume that we got 0.0.
    // Note: If we were doing excess returns, we'd need 0.0 - rf
    let missingReturn = 0.0
    match Map.tryFind (security, formationMonth) msfByPermnoMonth with
    | None -> security, missingReturn
    | Some x ->  
        match x.Ret with 
        | None -> security, missingReturn
        | Some r -> security, r

getSecurityReturn (amznPermno, YearMonth(2019,1))        

let portReturn =
    getPortfolioReturn getSecurityReturn exampleValueWeights2

portfoliosWithWeights
|> List.map (getPortfolioReturn getSecurityReturn)    


// Put it all together.
let sampleMonths = getSampleMonths (YearMonth(2010,5), YearMonth(2020,2)) 

sampleMonths |> List.rev |> List.take 3

let formMomtenumPort ym =
    ym
    |> getInvestmentUniverse
    |> restrictUniverse
    |> getMomentumSignals
    |> assignSignalSort "Momentum" 10
    |> List.map (giveValueWeights getMarketCap)
    |> List.map (getPortfolioReturn getSecurityReturn)  


(**
We can process months sequentially.
*)
(*** do-not-eval ***)
let momentumPortsSequential =
    sampleMonths
    |> List.collect formMomtenumPort 

(**
Or we can speed things up and process months in Parallel using
all available CPU cores. Note that the only changes are to 

1. Use `Array.Parallel.collect` intead of 
`List.collect`. The array collection is the only parallel 
collection in base F# and the module functions are somewhat limited, 
but if you google F# parallel processing
you can find other options and also asynchronous coding and PSeq 
(I mostly use PSeq for my parallel code).
2. `Array.Parallel.collect` expects to operate on arrays, so 
we need to mhave our portfolio returned as arrays instead of lists.
This is what we are doing with `formMomentumPortArray`.
*)

let formMomentumPortArray ym =
    ym 
    |> formMomtenumPort 
    |> List.toArray

let momentumPortsParallel =
    sampleMonths
    |> List.toArray
    |> Array.Parallel.collect formMomentumPortArray
