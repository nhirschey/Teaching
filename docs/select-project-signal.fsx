# Submitting your trading signal preferences.
You need to select your main trading signal. 
Everybody will examine a different signal, 
so you need to give me an ordered list of your preferred signals. 

I will randomly iterate through students and 
assign them their top choice from among the signals remaining.

The signals are listed in the "Project signals list.xlsx" file
that you can find on moodle. 
    - Use the **VARIABLE** column to identify 
      the variable that you want. 
    - Do not use any other columns to identify your variable. 
    - Only variables from that excel file are valid.

You will submit your choices as a .csv file. Here's how to do that.

Use the [FSharp.Data CsvProvider](https://fsprojects.github.io/FSharp.Data/library/CsvProvider.html) 
to construct your csv file. 
All the csv related stuff below comes from things discussed somewhere on that webpage.

First construct a sample, then use the type provider 
to define the type from the sample.

Below you will find a variable named "signals".
Do not modify it. This is to check that you
do not have a typo in your preferred signals.
The code that you use starts after the
"Code starts now" section.

We'll use List.mapi to create our rows.
List.mapi is like List.map, but it adds
the index of the list (i)
as a parameter to the function. 
This is useful when you want to use the index 
of the element in the list
as part of your function.

Here, we've ordered our list myPreferences
based on our first, second, 3rd choice etc.
So we're using the index of the element in the list as our
preference column.

0 is first choice, 1 is second choice, 2 is 3rd choice ... 
*)
let mySubmission =
    myPreferences
    // What we have below is the same as
    // |> List.mapi(fun i x -> rowCreator i x)
    //
    // but because we wrote rowCreator to accept i and x
    // as the first two function inputs, we can 
    // take the shortcut and do below.
    |> List.mapi rowCreator

(**
This is an array of rows.

Check your first preference
*)
let myFirstPreference = mySubmission |> List.head

myFirstPreference.StudentId // make sure it's not 7
myFirstPreference.Preference // should be 0
myFirstPreference.Signal // choose wisely

(*
Rather than an "list of csv rows", we want a "csv file".

Here's how we do that. We pass the SubmissionCsv.Rows contained
in the mySubmission array  to the
SubmissionCsv type constructor like so.
*)
let mySubmissionFile = new SubmissionCsv(mySubmission)

(**
Ok, let's write the file. Remember that `__SOURCE_DIRECTORY__`
is a magic variable that points to whatever folder this script file
(aka the source code file) is contained in.

So this will write a csv file in the current directory.
*)

let fileName = $"{myStudentId}.csv"
let fullFilePath = $"{__SOURCE_DIRECTORY__}/{fileName}"

mySubmissionFile.Save(fullFilePath)

(**
Now find that file and submit it. Also click on it in visual studio code;
you should be able to see what the file looks like. It's just a text file with a .csv extension.
*)

(**
and if you want to read the data back in from the file to see that it works:
*)
let backIn = SubmissionCsv.Load(fullFilePath)

backIn.Rows
|> Seq.toList
|> List.map(fun row -> row.Preference, row.Signal)
