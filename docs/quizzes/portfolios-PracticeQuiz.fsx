# Some good things to reference

[Anonymous Records](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/anonymous-records#syntax). You can read the above link for details, but the point of these is quite simple.

Records have been our main type for holding data for an observation. We've typically defined these ahead of time with a name before using them. This is good for important types that you will use frequently.

If you're using a particular record in only a few lines of code, then it can feel cumbersome to define the type beforehand. Anonymous records are a good solution in these circumstances. They are records that you can essentially use like regular records that we've been using, but you don't have to define the name of the record ahead of time.

I rarely use anonymous records, but you might find them useful for exploratory data manipulation. They're also kind of nice for these short problems because I don't need to define a record for each problem.

# Anonymous records
*)

(**
## Question 1

1. Create a *record* named `ExampleRec` that has an `X` field of type int and a `Y` field of type int. Create an example `ExampleRec` and assign it to a value named `r`.
2. Create an *anonymous record* that has an `X` field of type int and a `Y` field of type int. Create an example of the anonymous record and assign it to a value named `ar`.
*)

(*** include-it-raw:preDetails ***)
(*** define: ExampleRec, define-output: ExampleRec ***)

// a regular named record
type ExampleRec = { X : int; Y : int }
let r = { X = 1; Y = 2}
// an anonymous record. The difference is
// 1. We did not define the type ahead of time.
// 2. We put the pipe symbole "|" inside the curly braces.
let ar = {| X = 1; Y = 2|}
// Note that they are not the same type, so if you
// compare them they will be different even though
// the X and Y fields have the same values.
// For example, running `r = ar` 
// will give a compiler error

## Question 2
Imagine you have this array
*)

open System
type ArExample = { Date : DateTime; Value: float}
let arr = [|{ Date = DateTime(1990,1,1); Value = 1.25}
            { Date = DateTime(1990,1,2); Value = 2.25}
            { Date = DateTime(1991,1,1); Value = 3.25} |]

(**
1. Group the observations by a tuple of `(year,month)` and find the 
minimum value for each group. Report the result as a tuple of the group
and the minimum value [so it will be `((year, month), minValue)`].
2. Now, the same thing with anonymous records.
Group the observations by an Anonymous Record `{| Year = year; Month= month|}` and find the 
minimum value for each group. Report the result as an Anonymous record with a Group
field for the group and a value field for the minimum value [so it will be
`{| Group = {| Year = year; Month= month|}; Value = minValue |}`].
*)

(*** include-it-raw:preDetails ***)
(*** define: RecordsAndTransformations, define-output: RecordsAndTransformations ***)

// here I will explicitly put year and month in the final result
arr 
|> Array.groupBy(fun x -> x.Date.Year, x.Date.Month)
|> Array.map(fun (group, xs) ->
    let year, month = group // Explicitly access year, month; same as let a,b = (1,2)
    let minValue = xs |> Array.map(fun x -> x.Value)|> Array.min
    (year, month), minValue) // explicitly put it in the result

// here I will explicitly put year and month in the final result,
// but I will deconstruct them using pattern matching in the
// function input
arr 
|> Array.groupBy(fun x -> x.Date.Year, x.Date.Month)
|> Array.map(fun ((year, month), xs) -> // Explicitly pattern match year, month in function input
    let minValue = xs |> Array.map(fun x -> x.Value)|> Array.min
    (year, month), minValue) // explicitly put it in the result

// or
// since I'm just returning the grouping variable, there's really
// no need to deconstruct it into year, month at any point.
arr 
|> Array.groupBy(fun x -> x.Date.Year, x.Date.Month)
|> Array.map(fun (group, xs) -> // match group to (year,month) together
    let minValue = xs |> Array.map(fun x -> x.Value)|> Array.min
    group, minValue)

// Now using anonymous records
// This is where anonymous records can be useful.
// For example, sometimes grouping by many things, 
// using anonymous records like this make it more clear what the different
// grouping variables are because they have names.
// It's like a middle ground between tuples with no clear naming structure
// and regular named records that are very explicit.
arr 
|> Array.groupBy(fun x -> {| Year = x.Date.Year; Month = x.Date.Month |})
|> Array.map(fun (group, xs) -> 
    let year, month = group.Year, group.Month // explicit deconstruct 
    let minValue = xs |> Array.map(fun x -> x.Value)|> Array.min
    {| Group = {| Year = year; Month = month|}; Value = minValue |})

// or, do the same thing by returning the whole group without deconstructing
arr 
|> Array.groupBy(fun x -> {| Year = x.Date.Year; Month = x.Date.Month |})
|> Array.map(fun (group, xs) -> 
    let minValue = xs |> Array.map(fun x -> x.Value)|> Array.min
    {| Group = group; Value = minValue |})

# Portfolio Returns

## Question 1
Imagine that you have the following positions in your portfolio.
For each position you have a weight and a return.
What is the return of the entire portfolio?
*)

type PortReturnPos = { Id: string;  Weight: float; Return: float}
let stockPos = { Id = "stock"; Weight = 0.25; Return = 0.1 }
let bondPos = { Id = "bond"; Weight = 0.75; Return = 0.05}

(**
1. Group the observations by a tuple of `(year,month)` and find the 
minimum value for each group. Report the result as a tuple of the group
and the minimum value [so it will be `((year, month), minValue)`].
2. Now, the same thing with anonymous records.
Group the observations by an Anonymous Record `{| Year = year; Month= month|}` and find the 
minimum value for each group. Report the result as an Anonymous record with a Group
field for the group and a value field for the minimum value [so it will be
`{| Group = {| Year = year; Month= month|}; Value = minValue |}`].
*)

(*** include-it-raw:preDetails ***)
(*** define: PortfolioRet1, define-output: PortfolioRet1 ***)

// Remember that portfolio returns are a weighted average
// of the returns of the stocks in the portfolio. The weights
// are the position weights.

let stockAndBondPort = 
    stockPos.Weight*stockPos.Return + bondPos.Weight*bondPos.Return
// or, doing the multiplication and summation with collections
let weightXreturn =
    [|stockPos;bondPos|]
    |> Array.map(fun pos -> pos.Weight*pos.Return)
// look at it
weightXreturn
// now sum

# Sharpe Ratios
