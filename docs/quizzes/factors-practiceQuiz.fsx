On moodle, there is a set of investment lecture notes called "Finance Review". 
Please review the Lecture-08-APT.pdf document, including the appendix. 

In particular,

- What do we mean by a factor?
- The example showing how to hedge Barrick with GLD and SPY.
- Information ratios.

Imagine you have the below returns for IBM and SPY. 
IBM's factor beta on SPY and the (constant)
risk-free rate are given below too.
*)

type ReturnOb = { Time: int; Return : float }
let ibm =
    [| 
        { Time = 0; Return = 0.15 }
        { Time = 1; Return = 0.05 }
        { Time = 2; Return = 0.01 }
    |]

let spy =
    [| 
        { Time = 0; Return = 0.1 }
        { Time = 1; Return = 0.05 }
        { Time = 2; Return = -0.02 }

let riskFreeRate = 0.001
let ibmBetaOnSpy = 1.2

## Question 1
What are the weights on the risk-free asset and
SPY in the portfolio that hedges IBM's exposure to
SPY? 

1. Report the weight on the risk-free asset as a value named `wRf` of type `float`. 
2. Report the weight on the SPY portfolio as a value named `wSpy` of type `float`.

## Question 2
What are the returns for Times [0;1;2] on the portfolio 
that hedges IBM's factor exposure to SPY? 

1. Report results as a value named `hedgePortReturns` of type `ReturnOb array`.
*)

(*** include-it-raw:preDetails ***)

let hedgePortReturns =
    spy

## Question 3
Call the portfolio that hedges IBM's factor exposure to SPY
the hedge portfolio. What is the hedge portfolio's factor beta
on SPY? 

1. Report the answer as a value named `hedgePortBetaOnSpy` of type float.
*)

(*** include-it-raw:preDetails ***)
(*** define: BetaSPYHedgePort, define-output: BetaSPYHedgePort ***)

// 3. Hedge portfolio's factor beta on SPY
// See the lecture notes for a fuller explanation:
//
// From the portfolio return equation, the
// hedge portfolio return is
// r_hedgePort = wRf * rf + wSpy * Spy
// =>
// r_hedgePort - rf = (wSpy + wRf - 1) * rf + wSpy*(Spy -rf)
// r_hedgePort - rf = wSpy*(Spy - rf)
// So the beta is
let hedgePortBetaOnSpy = ibmBetaOnSpy

## Question 4
What are the returns for Times [0;1;2] on the portfolio
that is long IBM and short the portfolio that hedges
IBM's factor exposre to SPY?

1. Report results as a value named `longShortPortReturns` of type `ReturnOb array`.

(*** include-it-raw:preDetails ***)

    // but we'll use a Map collection so that we
    // practice like it's the real thing.

        // want to throw away all the None cases and return just
        // an array of the valid hedgeObs. 
        let matchingHedgeReturn = Map.tryFind ibmOb.Time hedgePortMap
        // in this example matchingHedgeReturn will always be Some hedgeOb.
        // But, we're using Map.tryFind and dealing with the possibility
        // that None could happen because it's good to practice
        // as if this were real code where bad things could happen.
        match matchingHedgeReturn with
        | None -> None // if there's no hedge return for ibmOb.Time return None

## Question 5
What is the alpha of IBM from the perspective of 
a factor model that uses SPY as the only risk factor? 

1. Report the result as a value named `alpha` of type float.

## Question 6
What is the information ratio of IBM from the perspective
of a factor model that uses SPY as the only risk factor?

1. Report the result as a value named `io` of type float.
