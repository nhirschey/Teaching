**Signal Code (e.g., be_me):**

This is the mid-term project. It is an exercise in exploratory data analysis, using your assigned trading signal as the data. There is a written component called **Signal Background** and a data analysis component called **Signal Analysis**. 

## Signal Background

Provide a written description of the signal you are using. Write the text in this cell after deleting the text explaining what to write.

Use a *maximum* of 1,000 words. The word count for a notbook cell is displayed at the bottom bar of the VS Code window when you are editing a cell. Notebook text cells are written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). You can find a short tutorial for markdown syntax at [https://commonmark.org/help/](https://commonmark.org/help/).

- Describe your signal and explain how it is constructed.
- Explain the economic motivation for why this may be a useful predictor of security returns or risk. Include your own perspective and any relevant outside perspectives (original study authors, famous investors, popular media, etc.).

## Signal Analysis

### First, make sure that you're referencing the correct files.

Here I'm assuming that you have a class folder with this `signal-exploration.ipynb` notebook and a `data` folder inside of it. The folder hierarchy would look like below where you
have the below files and folders accessible:

```code
/class
    signal-exploration.ipynb
    /data
        id_and_return_data.csv
        zero_trades_252d.csv
    
```
