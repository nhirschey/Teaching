# Working with Tuples and Records.

> Developed with [Davide Costa](https://github.com/DavideGCosta)

This set of exercises covers creating and manipulating tuples, records, and anonymous records.
Before you start it is a good idea to review the relevant sections of
the F# language reference (
[tuples](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/tuples),
[records](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/records),
and [anonymous records](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/anonymous-records)
) and
F# for fun and profit (
[tuples](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/tuples/) and
[records](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/records/))
before you start.

## Import the Football Players Data from the Csv File
*)

#r "nuget:FSharp.Data"
open FSharp.Data

(**
In order to import the data correctly we need to create the sample, define the type from the sample and then load the csv file.
We'll use [FSharp.Data CsvProvider](https://fsprojects.github.io/FSharp.Data/library/CsvProvider.html).
 
### Load the Csv file.  

We define the type from the csv sample file.
*)

let [<Literal>] CsvPath = __SOURCE_DIRECTORY__ + "/FootballPlayers.csv"
type FootballPlayersCsv = CsvProvider<CsvPath>

(**
This will load the sample csv file.
*)
let playerStatsTable = 
    FootballPlayersCsv.GetSample().Rows
    |> Seq.toList

(**
Let's see the first 5 rows from the loaded Csv data, stored in `playerStatsTable`.
Again, we do this by using the List `List.truncate` property.

H3 "Creating records"
(*** include-it-raw ***)


(**
Example: Define a record named `PlayerAndNation` with a field named `Player` that is a `string` and `Nation` that is a `string`. 
Then transform each element of the `playerStatsTable` List into a `PlayerAndNation` record.
*)

type PlayerAndNation =
    { Player : string 
      Nation : string }

(**
The above code creates a record type called `PlayerAndNation`.
This record contains two fields: `Player` of `string` type and `Nation` of `string` type.
Remember, if the types from the csv file are different an error will occur when creating an instance of the record.
 
Common types: 

- `string`, example: `"hello world"`
- `int`, example: `2`
- `float`, example: `2.0`
- `decimal`, example: `2.0m`

Check [basic types documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/basic-types)
to learn about F# basic types.

*)

(**
Now by having the record type created we can `map` the `playerStatsTable` rows to the record `PlayerAndNation`.
*)
playerStatsTable
|> List.map(fun x -> 
    { Player = x.Player
      Nation = x.Nation })
|> List.truncate 5 //just to observe the first 5 rows, not a part of the exercise.
(*** include-fsi-output ***)

(**
Note that you choose the name of the fields in the record. Instead of `Player` it could be anything.
The following code block for example would have also worked, 
but the field name for the player is `PlayerName` instead of `Player` and `Nationality` instead of `Nation`:
*)
type PlayerAndNation2 =
    { PlayerName : string 
      Nationality : string }

playerStatsTable
|> List.map(fun x -> 
    { PlayerName = x.Player
      Nationality = x.Nation })

(**
- Define a record named `PlayerAndTeam` with a field named `Player` that is a `string` and `Team` that is a `string`. 
Then transform each element of the `playerStatsTable` List into a `PlayerAndTeam` record.
*)

(*** include-it-raw:preDetails ***)
(*** define: PlayerAndTeamRecord, define-output: PlayerAndTeamRecord ***)

type PlayerAndTeam =
    { Player : string
      Team : string }

      Team = x.Team })

Now that you are used to work with `List.map` to organize the data into tuples, records and anonymous records.
Let's try to do it while applying some simple transformations as sum, multiplication, type transformations and so on.

Example: map the `playerStatsTable` to a tuple of player and age, but add 1 to age. ( `Player`, `Age + 1`)

When to use integers or floats/decimals:

  1. Use integers if the results of the calculations should be integers (1, 2, 3, 4, ...).
  2. Use floats or decimals if the results of the calculations may be floats or decimals (1.1, 2.1324, ...).

*)

(**
In this case, look how dividing using integers rounds the results to the nearest integers.
If the results are decimals you might prefer to get exact results.
For that you can use floats or decimals types.
In order to convert a variable to float you have to use the syntax: `float variable`.

- map the `playerStatsTable` to an anonymous record of player and goals scored, but divide goals scored by 2.0. ( `Player`, `float GoalsScored  / 2.0`)  
Hint: Remember that you have to transform GoalsScored to float.

Now that you are used to work with records and perform simple Transformations, map `playerStatsTable` to a record type that includes:  

- Player (`Player`) - type `string`  
- Nation (`Nation`) - type `string`  
- League (`League`) - type `string`  
- AgeNextYear (`Age + 1`) - type `int`  
- HalfGoalsScored (`GoalsScored / 2.0`) - type `float`  
  
Hint: Create a new type.
