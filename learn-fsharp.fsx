(**
The code on this site is mostly written in [F#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/languages/fsharp).
F# code tends to be as simple as equivalent Python or R code,
but it is usually faster and more robust.
This makes it a good language for finance, where simplicity, speed, and correctness are important.

## Resources for learning F#

0 Microsoft's [Learn F# site](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/fsharp). In particular:

  * [Luis Quintanilla's F# for Beginners YouTube series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oUFghYOp89baYFBTGxUkC7Z), with code samples in [this github repo.](https://github.com/luisquintanilla/fsharp-101-samples)
  
  * [Self-guided F# tutorials](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/fsharp-first-steps/)
  
  * The [What is F#?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/what-is-fsharp?) page.
